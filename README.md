# Ag-Productivity-US-EU

This code replicates the figures and tables presented in the article “Components of Agricultural Productivity Change: Replication of US Evidence and Extension to the EU”, published in Applied Economics Perspectives and Policy. 

The files are as follows:

-	01a-01e: Compiles all data needed for estimation. Data are either automatically downloaded by the program, or the links and instructions to do so are provided (in R).
-	02a-02h: Estimates productivity indices and components for the state-level data provided by USDA (in R).
-	03: Estimates productivity index for the country-level data provided by USDA (in R).
-	04a-04b: Estimates productivity indices and components for the country-level data provided by Eurostat (in R).
-	05a-05b: Estimates productivity indices and components for the country-level International Agricultural Productivity data set provided by USDA (in R).
-	06_Stata_CompareDensities.do: Estimate the kernel-analysis procedure (in Stata).

The final files contain the data envelopment analysis (DEA) programs to estimate and decompose all productivity indices computed in this study. 

The script was successfully run in R version 4.2.0.
